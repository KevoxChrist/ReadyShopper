# ReadyShopper
This is a shopping list program where the user has the ability to:
1. Add, edit, and delete items within a list
2. Name/rename any list
3. Create new lists, with the ability to go back and forth between current and any previously created lists.
4. View all lists which were created, with the ability to select, edit, and delete any list.

All items within a list will still be present no matter which list you are currently on.

Have Fun!!!!
